## Browser support
Spectre uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make most styles compatible with earlier browsers and [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for CSS resets. Spectre is designed for modern browsers. For best compatibility, these browsers are recommended:

- Chrome (LAST 4)
- Microsoft Edge (LAST 4)
- Firefox (EXTENDED SUPPORT RELEASE)
- Safari (LAST 4)
- Opera (LAST 4)
- Internet Explorer 10+

Spectre supports Internet Explorer 10+, but some HTML5 and CSS3 features are not perfectly supported by Internet Explorer.
